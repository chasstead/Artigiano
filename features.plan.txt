Feature list:

    User registration system:
        Login
        Register
        Change profile (password, address, email address)
        Retrieve password
        Deactivate account
        Confirm email address
        User priviliges (admin, moderators)
        Post code/address lookup - needs to deny the user's address if they are outside the delivery zone

    Ordering system:
        Create, update, retrieve and delete products (price, name, description)
        Create, update, retrieve and delete product categories (subcategory support?)
        Shopping cart:
            Add, edit and delete from shopping cart
            Checkout and pay - payment gateway

The payment gateway will store the user's credit card details and their billing address. I think we should not store any of that, only the users delivery address.
